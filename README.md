## The Compounding Engineering Loop

This implementation embodies the core philosophy: **each unit of work makes subsequent work easier**.

```

**How it works:**

1. **Auto-Injection**: All AI operations (`review`, `triage`, `plan`, `work`) automatically receive relevant past learnings
2. **Auto-Codification**: Every todo resolution automatically extracts and stores learnings
3. **Pattern Recognition**: The system identifies similar issues and suggests solutions based on past successes
4. **Continuous Improvement**: The more you use it, the smarter it gets

### Knowledge Base Features

- **Persistent Learning**: Learnings stored in `.knowledge/` as structured JSON
- **Smart Retrieval**: Keyword-based similarity matching (extensible to vector embeddings)
- **Auto-Documentation**: `AI.md` automatically updated with consolidated learnings
- **Tagged Search**: Filter learnings by category, source, or topic

## Roadmap

See our [detailed Roadmap](https://strategic-automation.github.io/dspy-compounding-engineering/roadmap/) for upcoming features.

Key focus areas:
- **GitHub Integration**: Create Issues, post PR comments, manage Projects
- **Vector Embeddings**: Upgrade from keyword matching to semantic similarity
- **Auto-Triage**: Pattern-based auto-approval/rejection of similar findings
- **Learning Analytics**: Dashboard showing knowledge growth and reuse

## Configuration

Edit `.env` to configure your LLM provider:

```bash
# OpenAI
DSPY_LM_PROVIDER=openai
DSPY_LM_MODEL=gpt-5.1-codex
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# Anthropic
DSPY_LM_PROVIDER=anthropic
DSPY_LM_MODEL=claude-4-5-haiku
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Ollama (Local)
DSPY_LM_PROVIDER=ollama
DSPY_LM_MODEL=qwen3

# OpenRouter (Multi-Model Access)
DSPY_LM_PROVIDER=openrouter
DSPY_LM_MODEL=x-ai/grok-4.1-fast:free
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
```

## Usage

### 1. Review Code

Run a comprehensive multi-agent review on your current changes:

```bash
# Review latest local changes
uv run python cli.py review

# Review entire project (not just changes)
uv run python cli.py review --project

# Review a specific PR (requires gh cli)
uv run python cli.py review https://github.com/user/repo/pull/123
```

### 2. Triage Findings

Process the findings generated by the review:

```bash
uv run python cli.py triage
```

- **Yes**: Approve and convert to ready todo
- **Next**: Skip or delete
- **All**: Batch approve all remaining items
- **Custom**: Change priority or details

### 3. Work on Todos or Plans

Unified command for resolving todos or executing plans using ReAct agents:

```bash
# Resolve all P1 priority todos
uv run python cli.py work p1

# Resolve specific todo by ID
uv run python cli.py work 001

# Execute a plan file
uv run python cli.py work plans/feature.md

# Preview changes without applying (dry run)
uv run python cli.py work p1 --dry-run

# Use isolated worktree (safe parallel execution)
uv run python cli.py work p1 --worktree

# Control parallelization
uv run python cli.py work p2 --sequential  # Sequential execution
uv run python cli.py work p2 --workers 5   # 5 parallel workers
```

This will:

1. Auto-detect input type (todo ID, plan file, or pattern)
2. Use ReAct reasoning for intelligent file operations
3. Execute in-place (default) or in isolated worktree (`--worktree`)
4. Process todos in parallel (default) or sequentially (`--sequential`)
5. Mark todos as complete (`*-complete-*.md`)
6. Clean up worktrees automatically

### 4. Generate Commands

Generate shell commands from natural language descriptions:

```bash
# Generate a command
uv run python cli.py generate-command "find all Python files modified in the last week"

# Execute the generated command (use with caution)
uv run python cli.py generate-command "list large files" --execute
```

### 5. Plan New Features

Generate a detailed implementation plan:

```bash
uv run python cli.py plan "Add user authentication with OAuth"
```

### 6. Codify Learnings

Capture and codify learnings into the knowledge base:

```bash
uv run python cli.py codify "Always validate user input before database operations"
uv run python cli.py codify "Use factory pattern for agent creation" --source retro
```

## Architecture

The system is built on a layered architecture designed for modularity and compounding intelligence:

### 1. Interface Layer (CLI)
- **Entry Point**: `cli.py` uses `Typer` to provide a robust command-line interface.
- **Commands**: Maps user intents (e.g., `review`, `work`) to specific workflows.

### 2. Orchestration Layer (Workflows)
- **Logic**: Python scripts in `workflows/` orchestrate complex multi-step processes.
- **Responsibility**: Manages state, handles user interaction, and coordinates agents.
- **Key Workflows**:
    - **Unified Work**: Combines planning and execution using ReAct loops.
    - **Review Pipeline**: Parallelizes multiple specialized review agents.
    - **Triage System**: Manages findings and prioritizes work.

### 3. Intelligence Layer (DSPy Agents)
- **Signatures**: Declarative definitions of AI tasks in `agents/`.
- **Modules**: `dspy.Module` implementations that chain thoughts and actions.
- **Optimization**: Agents are optimized via DSPy teleprompters.

### 4. Knowledge Layer (Compounding Engine)
- **Storage**: JSON-based knowledge base in `.knowledge/`.
- **Retrieval**: `KBPredict` wrapper automatically injects relevant context into agent calls.
- **Learning**: `LearningExtractor` codifies outcomes from every task into reusable patterns.

### 5. Infrastructure Layer (Utilities)
- **Git Service**: Manages isolated worktrees for safe execution.
- **Project Context**: Efficiently gathers and token-limits codebase context.
- **Todo Service**: Standardizes the unit of work (Markdown-based todos).

## Philosophy

Based on the [Compounding Engineering](https://every.to/source-code/my-ai-had-already-fixed-the-code-before-i-saw-it) philosophy:

- **Plan → Delegate → Assess → Codify** (fully implemented)
- **Each unit of work makes subsequent work easier** (via KB auto-injection)
- **Systematic beats heroic** (automated learning and reuse)
- **Quality compounds over time** (system gets smarter with use)
- **Knowledge is automatically codified** (not optional)
