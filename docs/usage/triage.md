# Triage Workflow

The `triage` command is your interactive dashboard for processing code review findings. It allows you to rapidly approve, reject, or modify the suggestions generated by the `review` command.

## Usage

```bash
compounding triage
```

## Interactive Mode

When you run `triage`, the CLI enters an interactive session. It presents findings one by one.

### Interface

```text
[Finding 1/5] - SecuritySentinel
File: src/auth.py
Line: 45
Priority: P1 (High)

Use of 'md5' is insecure for password hashing.
Recommendation: Use 'bcrypt' or 'argon2' instead.

[y]es / [n]ext / [a]ll / [c]ustom / [q]uit: 
```

### Options

-   **[y]es**: Accept the finding. This converts it into a **Todo** file (e.g., `todos/101-security-fix.md`) ready for work.
-   **[n]ext**: Skip/Reject this finding. It will be marked as skipped.
-   **[a]ll**: Batch accept **all remaining** findings in the queue.
-   **[c]ustom**: Edit the finding details (priority, description) before accepting.
-   **[q]uit**: Exit the triage session.

## Batch Processing

Triage also supports auto-categorization based on priority levels (P1, P2, P3) determined by the agents.

-   **P1**: Critical issues (Security, Crashes). Default: Block release.
-   **P2**: Major issues (Performance, Logic).
-   **P3**: Minor issues (Style, Documentation).

## Outcome

After triage:
1.  **Approved** findings become **Todo** files (`todos/*.md`).
2.  **Skipped** findings are archived or deleted.
3.  The system learns from your decisions (e.g., if you consistently reject a certain type of finding, it may learn to stop flagging it - *planned feature*).

You can then run `compounding work` to automatically fix the approved todos.
