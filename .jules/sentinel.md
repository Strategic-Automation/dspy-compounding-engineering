## 2025-02-23 - Replaced MD5 with SHA-256 for Hashing
**Vulnerability:** Use of insecure MD5 hashing algorithm for cache keys in `utils/knowledge/compression.py`, `utils/knowledge/docs.py`, and `utils/token/counter.py`.
**Learning:** While MD5 was used for caching and not password hashing, its presence triggers SAST tools and poses collision vulnerabilities. Upgrading to SHA-256 prevents static analysis warnings and complies with modern security standards without sacrificing performance significantly.
**Prevention:** Always use secure hashing algorithms (like SHA-256 or better) even for non-cryptographic purposes (like cache keys) to avoid collision risks and pass static security analysis checks.
